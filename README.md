## My process
This project came when a back injury decided to not let me sit down for over 30mins at a time so I sort of watched tv for 5 days. none the less I'm back now and I want to move past this project so I will leave flaws as is and see if the community can help with my queries. I'm finding it difficult to get my specific questions answered that I think you'd only get with a few friends or a class etc.. I'm on the look out for people starting out in web design or really any community to get some niche help with.
